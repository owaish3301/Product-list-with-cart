## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](ilwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
- I learned more about position: fixed
- I learned about ellipsis
- Gained more experience with Tailwind CSS
- Improved my JavaScript skills, particularly in Readind data from file, DOM manipulation and event handling

### Continued development
- I plan to create another version of this project which will provide data of cart items from the backend using Express.
- I also want to add cookies to remember which items were added to the cart so when the user comes back, their progress will be saved.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me with styling and responsive design.
